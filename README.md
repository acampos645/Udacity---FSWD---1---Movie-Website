# Movie Trailers Website
The purpose of this project was to practice using Python classes to generate the contect for a static web page. In this case, the page shows some of my favorite movies.

In this version of the project, the request library was used to retrieve data from www.TheMovieDB.org's database as outlined in their API documentation.

## Python
Please note that in order to run the files in this project, Python will need to be installed on your system.  This can be done by following the relevant instructions on Python.org.  Downloads can be found here:

*[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Requests Library
The requests library was used in this project to interact with the www.TheMovieDB.org API.  Information about this library and installation instructions can be found here:

*[http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)

## Accessing Project Files

The project files have been uploaded into the following Github repository where they can be downloaded:

*[https://github.com/acampos645/Udacity---FSWD---1---Movie-Website.git](https://github.com/acampos645/Udacity---FSWD---1---Movie-Website.git)

Once the files have been downloaded, unzip them and open the 'entertainment_center.py'.  Then run this code using a Python compiler to enjoy a list of my favorite movies!

## TheMovieDB API
Documentation about TheMovieDB API can be found on their website at the following address:

##Future direction the App

Moving forward, I would like to look into transitioning to a dynamic web page that would allow the user to add their own favorite movies to the page.  Using the Movie class structure, the only thing needed is a title to add a poster and trailer to the page.
